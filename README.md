# I'm Andrew Chan!

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Oregon, currently exploring everything from AI and NLP to embedded systems and arduino. I build things that combine **code, creativity, and control** whether it's a jazz backing track generator, a Linux firewall with React frontend, or a container system built with raw syscalls.

## Technical Projects

- **Duck Bank** — Multi-threaded bank simulation in C using semaphores, IPC, and shared memory.
- **Netfilter Firewall Module** — Linux kernel module + Netlink socket + SQLite logging + React dashboard.
- **Rubik's Cube ML** — Used ML models (Decision Tree, Ridge, Random Forest) to rank Rubik's Cube cross solutions.
- **Abstractive Summarization System** — NLP project using sequence-to-sequence models with attention to generate human-like summaries of input text.
- **Jazz Backing Track Generator** — Python project using `music21` and `pretty_midi` to generate metronome, chords, basslines, and swing-style drums.
- **Minidock Project** — Lightweight container system using `chroot`, namespaces, and file isolation — written in C with Linux system calls.
